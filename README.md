# 😄 Face Emotion Recognition using CNN

A deep learning-based Python project that performs **real-time face emotion recognition** using webcam input. The model is built with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and trained on facial expression datasets to classify emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Emotion-Recognition.git
cd Face-Emotion-Recognition
2. Install the dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the model (optional)
If you want to retrain the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py
4. Run real-time emotion detection
bash
Copy
Edit
python src/detect_emotion.py
This will start your webcam and display real-time emotion predictions over detected faces.

😊 Emotions Detected
Happy

Sad

Angry

Surprise

Neutral

Fear (if included in training)

📊 Dataset
You can use publicly available datasets like:

FER2013 – Facial Expression Recognition 2013

Or your own labeled dataset placed in the dataset/ directory.

📌 Features
Real-time facial emotion detection using webcam

Easy to train on custom datasets
